    python3 ants.py

### Argument examples

You can use some arguments when running the program. Multiple arguments can beused at the same time and their order doesn't matter.

#### Behavior:

    python3 ants.py beh_s=rlbn

where `rlbn` can be any sequence shorter than 15 characters long with characters r, l, b and n. Characters correspond to rotations that the ants make:

    r = right = 90째
    l = left = -90째
    b = back = 180째
    n = neutral = 0째

#### Number of ants:

    python3 ants.py ant_n=n

where `n` can be any integer value greater than 0. (`n > 1000` not recommended)

#### Scale:

    python3 ants.py scale=k

where `s` can be any integer value greater than 0. Default 1. (`s = 2^k` recommended, otherwise some graphical problems may appear)

    python3 ants.py f=1

1 = True, 0 = False. Default 0.
